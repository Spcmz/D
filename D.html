    <h1>Before anything else…</h1>
    <p>
      I know that sometimes I messed up.  
      I know I hurt you, and that I may have changed the way you see me.
      <br><br>
      I’m truly sorry, babe.
      <br><br>
      I don’t expect this to erase anything,  
      but I promise I’ll do my best — every day —  
      to make you feel loved and appreciated the way you deserve.

      You have a patience that calms everything around you.  
      There’s an innocence in you that feels rare and pure.
      <br><br>
      Gentle. Kind. Soft in the way that matters most.

    <p>
      Distance isn’t easy.
      <br><br>
      There are days I wish I could reach for your hand  
      instead of my phone.
      <br><br>
      But somehow, you’ve still become my comfort,  
      my calm,  
      my favorite part of the day.
    </p>

  <!-- Future -->
  <section class="section fade">
    <p>
      One day, this distance will just be a memory.

      Until then, I choose patience.  
      I choose effort.  
      I choose you.
